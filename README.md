# Criminal-Prediction

The first demo (demo.ipynb) is based on pretrained resnet with transfer learning on criminal and non-criminal faces, together with a tkinter file (tkin.py) to show the prediction result.

To use the code, first mkdir new filepaths './data' and './model', then prepare the criminal facial images together with other non-criminal facial images.

Due to the limit of images and models, the model performance is limited.
